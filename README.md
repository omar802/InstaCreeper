# InstaCreeper
Mass Instagram Image Downloader

<b>First of all, this program only works for downloading public users of Instagram or users who you already follow.</b>

With that said, you'll need to have the following in order for the code to execute:
1. Python needs to be installed on your computer.
2. Create a director (dir) and inside of it create your environment ‘env’ with virtualenv and activate it.
3. Create a requirements.txt
4. Install the following libraries: BeautifulSoup4 , Selenium, also lxml
5. Download the Chrome web driver from here https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads
6. Make sure that your virtual environment is running.
7. Make sure that you are logged into instagram.com on the Chrome web browser so you can download from non public users who you already follow.
8. Modify the Url so that it goes to the users profile you want to download from.
9. Depending on how many images the user has you'll need to change the scroll counter number. 90 is good for about 1000 images so do your math.

10. Thats pretty much it, you'll be able to download all images. I still haven't played around with modifying the code to also download the videos but you guys can do it if you please. 

<b>Enjoy!!!</b>
